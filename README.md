# Microsoft Engage 2021



## Teams Clone


### The Challenge
Build a Microsoft Teams clone
Your solution should be a fully functional prototype with at least one mandatory functionality - a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other using your product to have a video conversation.

### The Method
Agile development is a mindset whose values and principles provide guidance on how to create and respond to change and how to deal with uncertainty.

It is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and turbulent environment. It's really about thinking through how you can understand what's going on in the environment that you're in today, identify what uncertainty you're facing, and figure out how you can adopt to that as you go along.

### SPRINT
Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Each iteration consists of two- to four-week sprints, where each sprintâ€™s goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.
